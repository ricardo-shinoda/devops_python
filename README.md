This is a repo dedicated to study Python.

To run this files hit run but that is just possible because there is a file "launch.json" with some script on it.

Otherwise VSCODE is not reading the python3 version, it's is considering only the python version

Another way to run is to run direct on the terminal by: python3 -u file path
